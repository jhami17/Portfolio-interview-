I will continue to use these programs in coding as a way to make my own basis for things in school. Listing my work or creating a whole site to list my creations. These all tested my limits in what I could do and helped me realize my boundaries and when to push them. HTML & CSS were extremely useful to learn and use, along with P5.js to execute the code. 

Javascript, Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation and Advanced: Games and Visualizations were helpful to write code and make playable features. Along with the coding experiences I got alongside, it was fun to work on something useful or fun at the end. 

The Hackathon, and Micro-Bit were extremely challenging in new ways than I had not experienced prior. With the code of the hackathon being something new with the mouse features and functions, it was fun to learn how to code something different. The Micro-Bit was complicated in terms of transferring to the actual Micro-Bit but after that, it was extremely fascinating learning how to transfer code to a whole new device. 

The Live Coding Challenge. Was difficult as a summative but all around fun to execute and code. The coding functions were familiar, although the coding structure was a little different than I was used to. Making a coding follow along was very enjoyable to create and come up with.

Algorithms Exploration and Git' n Going, using a new form of writing down my code was interesting to learn and execute. Although learning how to code on GitHub it opened a new area for me to explore and use when I can. 


How will you continue learning about computer science?
   To be successful in computer science you need to become a good programmer, but you also need to learn how to write. Take the time to develop good business and    technical writing skills as you study computer science. Take advantage of all resources available.


What should one take note of on your portfolio?
   Someone should take notice in the game that was created. simple use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. the concept of the functions and uses along the side.


How does computer science/programming give you what you need to continue learning?
   Learning Computer Science basics is like learning how to drive your computer. When you have a better idea about whatâ€™s happening inside your computer, you know how to drive it properly. Computer Science is about what computers can do.  Programming is often used as a means to introduce important concepts in computer science, e.g. Introduction to Computer Science Using JavaScript.
