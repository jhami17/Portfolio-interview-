I will continue to use these programs in coding as a way to make my own basis for things in school. Listing my work or creating a whole site to list my creations. These all tested my limits in what I could and helped me realize my boundaries and when to push them. HTML & CSS were extremely useful to learn and use, along with P5.js to execute the code. 

Javascript, Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation and Advanced: Games and Visualizations were helpful to write code and make playable features. Along with the coding experiences I got alongside, it was fun to work on something useful or fun at the end. 

The Hackathon, and Micro-Bit were extremely challenging in new ways than I had not experienced prior. With the code of the hackathon being something new with the mouse features and functions, it was fun to learn how to code something different. The Micro-Bit was complicated in terms of transferring to the actual Micro-Bit but after that, it was extremely fascinating learning how to transfer code to a whole new device. 

The Live Coding Challenge. Was difficult as a summative but all around fun to execute and code. The coding functions were familiar, although the coding structure was a little different than I was used to. Making a coding follow along was very enjoyable to create and come up with.

Algorithms Exploration and Git' n Going, using a new form of writing down my code was interesting to learn and execute. Although learning how to code on GitHub it opened a new area for me to explore and use when I can.
